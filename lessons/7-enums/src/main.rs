// You may be familiar with native enum types if you've programmed in Java, C, or C#. Though Rust enums are in fact
// *much* more powerful than their counterparts. Rust enums are more formally an kind of algebraic data type (ADT), and
// more specifially they are a *sum type* that also goes by the names *tagged union*, *variant*, or *discriminated
// union*. The key feature of sum type ADTs is that they allow us to express many different kinds of data in a single
// type while retaining type safety and readability.
