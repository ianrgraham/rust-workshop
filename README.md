# Setup

Setting up Rust on your computer is easy! The simplest way to accomplish this on
MacOS and Linux (including WSL) is to download and install `rustup` with the following
shell command

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Though if you're on Windows (and wish to not setup WSL), the native installer 
can be found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). 
Additional installation methods for `rustup` and other standalone Rust releases 
are found [here](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html).

`rustup` is a handy tool from which we can install and update compiler toolchains,
editor tools, you name it!
